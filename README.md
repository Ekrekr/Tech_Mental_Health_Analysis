# Mental Health in Tech Analysis
This project originated as an entry for the Bristol Computer Science Society's annual Hackathon. This analysis uses the [Mental Health in Tech Survey open source data](https://osmihelp.org/) from their 2017 survey. 

**-- Project Status: Paused**

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify trends in mental health problems of those working in the tech industry. The results from this study should be used to detect early signs of disorders and mitigate the particular vulnerabilities of those working in the tech industry.

### Methods Used
 * One Hot encoding
 * Random Forests
 * Data Visualisation
 * Predictive Modelling
 * Decision Trees

### Technologies
 * Python
 * Jupyter notebooks
 * Anaconda

## Project Description
This analysis uses the [Mental Health in Tech Survey open source data](https://osmihelp.org/), currently just from their 2017 collection but other years should be included in later versions. Currently however the most important next step would be to find results from another mental health survey from a similar population distribution (to prevent bias) of a randomised sample of the population in order to establish a baseline for comparison.
